    "The Number data type in Python encompasses multiple forms. The int type denotes whole numbers, while float represents numbers with decimal points. The bool type, a subset of int, takes two values: True or False. Complex numbers, utilized less frequently in general programming but essential in specific domains like signal processing, are represented by the complex type. Strings, on the other hand, are sequences of characters. "
